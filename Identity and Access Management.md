IAM (Identity and Access Management) is the framework of policies, processes, and technologies that ensures the right individuals have the right access to the right resources at the right time.


PAM (Privileged Access Management) is a subset of IAM (Identity and Access Management) focused on securing, controlling, and monitoring accounts with elevated privileges—such as admin, root, or service accounts.

```
IAM and PAM both integrate with Active Directory. IAM uses AD to manage and authenticate users, while PAM uses AD to secure and control privileged accounts.
