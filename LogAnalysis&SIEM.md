Log Analysis & And basic SIEM

> Defination:

🔹 Log Analysis
- Log analysis is the process of collecting, parsing, and interpreting log data generated by systems, networks, and applications to:
  - Detect security incidents
  - Troubleshoot issues
  - Monitor performance and user activity
- Logs are machine-generated records of events

🔹 SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)
- A SIEM is a centralized platform that:
  - Collects logs from across the organization (firewalls, endpoints, servers, cloud)
  - Normalizes and correlates data to find related events
  - Generates alerts and reports for analysts

In simple terms:

👉 SIEM = Log collection + Correlation + Analysis + Alerting

> Key Features

> Use case
- Log Analyis, Pattern analysis
- Infra and Network Troubleshooting
- Cybersecurity for monitoring and analyzing

> Knowledge: What You Need to Understand

🔹 Types of Logs
- Application Logs: Messages from specific applications, providing insights into their status, errors, warnings, and other operational details.
- Audit Logs: Events, actions, and changes occurring within a system or application, providing a history of user activities and system behavior.
- Security Logs: Security-related events like logins, permission alterations, firewall activities, and other actions impacting system security.
- Server Logs: System logs, event logs, error logs, and access logs, each offering distinct information about server operations.
- System Logs: Kernel activities, system errors, boot sequences, and hardware status, aiding in diagnosing system issues.
- Network Logs: Communication and activity within a network, capturing information about events, connections, and data transfers.
- Database Logs: Activities within a database system, such as queries performed, actions, and updates.
- Web Server Logs: Requests processed by web servers, including URLs, source IP addresses, request types, response codes, and more.

🔹 Analysis Context
- Pattern, Corralation, action
- Timeline, Timestamp, Super Timelines
- Common Patterns, Abnormal User Behavior (Multiple failed login attempts, Unusual login times, Geographic anomalies, Frequent password changes, Unusual user-agent strings)
- Intermitern, recurrent, seldom
- Action/Status: failures, errors, start, stop, halt, refuse
- Severity and Status: Fatal,Critical (or crit), Warning (or warn), Alert, Emergency (or emerg), Info (or informational), Debug, Trace, Success, OK 
- Operational States and Events : Abnormal, Shutdown, Restart, Initialize (or init), Connect (or connecting, connection, connected), Disconnect (or disconnected), Timeout, Crash, Hang, Online / Offline, Up / Down
- Problem Descriptions : Exception, Invalid, Illegal, Denied, Rejected, Unauthorized, Failed to (e.g., "Failed to connect", "Failed to load"), Unable, Cannot (or can not, can't), Missing, Corrupt, Unavailable, Error Value, Out of memory, Null Pointer
- System/Security Related : Unauthorized access, Login fail, Authentication fail, SQL Error, Denial of Service (or DoS), Infection, Vulnerability
- What to looking for : The IP address, The timestamp, The HTTP method (POST, GET, or PUT, for example),The URL, The user-agent,

🔹 Example Correlations

🔹 Example Correlation Rule

🔹 Correlation Attributes

🔹 Correlating Multiple Log Sources and Multiple Techniques

🔹 Term
- Log Identification | Know what sources to collect	| Firewalls, endpoints, servers, AD
- Log Parsing	| Extract key fields (IP, user, event type)	| Use regex or scripts
- Filtering	| Focus on relevant events	| Search for “failed login”
- Correlation	| Link multiple events	| Login failure + privilege escalation
- Timeline | Analysis	Order events chronologically	| Build attack timeline
- Anomaly Detection	| Spot abnormal patterns	| Unusual login times or geolocation
- Query

> Skills: What You Need to Be Able to Do
- Tools Skills: Log Analysis, Query, Correlation amd Parsing
- Tools: grep, find, search
- Basic :

#### Start tcpdump with a specific interface
🔹 wireshark -i <interface> -k

- Simple Use Case Scenario :

> What I learned:
- I learned about TCP/IP (knowledge).
- I used Wireshark to capture and analyze packets (skill).
- I documented my results and shared screenshots on GitHub (proof).
