> Defination: ......

> Key functions

> Use case
- Packet Anayzer
- Infra and Network Troubleshooting
- Cybersecurity for monitoring and analyzing

> Knowledge: What You Need to Understand

🔹 Networking Fundamentals
- OSI Model: Focus on Layers 2–4 (Data Link, Network, Transport).
- Common Protocols: Ethernet, ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, TLS, DHCP.
- Packet Structure: Understand headers, payloads, ports, and sequence numbers.

🔹 Security Context
- Network Attacks: ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, port scanning, exfiltration.
- Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Suspicious IPs, unusual ports, malformed packets.
- Encryption Awareness: Know what you can’t see in HTTPS vs HTTP.

> Skills: What You Need to Be Able to Do
- Tools Skills: Capture and Filter Packet - Analyzing
- Basic :

#### Start tcpdump with a specific interface
🔹 wireshark -i <interface> -k

> What I learned:
- I learned about TCP/IP (knowledge).
- I used Wireshark to capture and analyze packets (skill).
- I documented my results and shared screenshots on GitHub (proof).

Mapping to Real-World Environment
- Troubleshooting HP ArcSight SIEM - To verify the log sent to ArcSight logger
