 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio & Learning Journey

A Practical Collection of Hands-On Labs, Notes, and Real-World Security Projects.

This portfolio reflects my working experince, online learning and home lab experience. The online learning, labs and exercises here build core concepts, but real environments differ in scale, complexity, and constraints. My goal is to use these labs as a stepping stone to develop the thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability required in actual enviroemnt . This portfolio represents my foundation and my readiness to adapt these skills to actual enviroment.




These environments help me build strong foundational skills in cybersecurity; however, I fully understand that real-world enterprise environments are more complex, varied, and often unpredictable. My goal is to use these labs as a stepping stone to develop the thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability required in actual security operations.
