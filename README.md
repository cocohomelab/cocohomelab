 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio & Learning Journey

A Practical Collection of Hands-On Labs, Notes, and Real-World Security Projects.

This portfolio reflects my working experience and ongoing learning journey. The learning paths, labs, and exercises included here strengthen my core fundamentals; however, I recognize that real-world enterprise environments differ greatly in scale, complexity, and operational constraints. My goal is to use these experiences as a stepping stone to develop the mindset, problem-solving ability, and adaptability required in actual environments. 

This portfolio represents my technical foundation and my readiness to apply and expand these skills within real enterprise enviroment.
