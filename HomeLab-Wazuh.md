Wazuh HomeLab
- Built a Wazuh-based cybersecurity homelab to gain hands-on experience in SIEM, EDR, and XDR operations, demonstrating how diverse cybersecurity components integrate seamlessly.
- Explored how open-source telemetry, detection, and response map to enterprise security frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CIS).
- Implemented use cases including File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Indicator of Compromise (IOC) management, and Active Response automation.
- Developed an understanding of how Wazuh parallels commercial solutions like Trellix, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Defender for endpoint protection.

Key To understand:

✅ How to make your GitHub notes count as a real portfolio:

Do these and it becomes a strong portfolio:
- Organize your repo clearly
  - e.g., /CrowdStrike, /Trellix, /Wazuh, /EDR, /SIEM
- Add real hands-on examples
  - Screenshots
  - Lab steps
  - Detection queries
  - Configuration snippets
  - Troubleshooting notes
- Include a README
  - Explain what the repo is and what you learned.
- Show your thinking
  - Add summaries, diagrams, comparisons (e.g., “Wazuh vs CrowdStrike”).
  - Interviewers love when you show analysis, not just notes.
