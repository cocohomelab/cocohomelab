Wazuh HomeLab
- Built a Wazuh-based cybersecurity homelab to gain hands-on experience in SIEM, EDR, and XDR operations, demonstrating how diverse cybersecurity components integrate seamlessly.
- Explored how open-source telemetry, detection, and response map to enterprise security frameworks (MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CIS).
- Implemented use cases including File Integrity Monitoring (FIM), Indicator of Compromise (IOC) management, and Active Response automation.
- Developed an understanding of how Wazuh parallels commercial solutions like Trellix, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft Defender for endpoint protection.
